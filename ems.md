## Project Plan for Grand AM EMS replacement

### Harness

#### Sensors
1. Cam position sensor 3 wire
2. Crank position sensor 2 wire
3. MAP - manifold absolute pressure sub connector
4. IAT - Intake temperature 2 wire
5. TPS - Throttle position 3 wire
6. EGO - O2 sensor 2 wire
7. CHT - coolant temperature sub connector

#### Output
1. Injectors subconnector
2. Ignition advance - Ask Andy about the GM DIS.  3 connectors on Ignition module.  Harness has 2 wire and 4 wire connector, additional 2 wire connector from under engine.

#### subconnector
1. Injectors 6 injectors
2. CHT 
3. MAP 
4. total of 10 wires (seemes light on wires)

#### total wires
24 wires for the 2 wire DIS, 26 for 4 wire hookup, and 28 for total DIS hookup -- need to vet requirements

#### Fit for Future
1. MAF - required to calculate load, mpg, etc 3 wires
2. Boost - extra pair for electric turbo x gate (2 wires?)
3. IAC - Idle air control
4. 4 aux wires using CAN

#### Notes
* spec for coolant temperature and injector harness should follow GM adapter at left of engine bay
* GM fit adapters for harness

#### Dimensions
* TODO: Number of wires, harnesses
* Distance from inside firewall to con1
* Distance from outside firewall to split1

## New Gm harness from junkyard
* All required connectors labeled
* Researching pin outs of connectors
* mapped out dis 4 pin 3 x calculated signal on dIS for jaguar board
* ignition advance signal mapped possibly backwards
